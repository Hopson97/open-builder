## History

Originally, this was going to be a Zombie game, but I got very bored of that very quickly, and so changed the project to be a voxel game instead.

As a result of this, the code was created for the zombie game, so when I decided to switch over, the code got messy very quickly.

To combat this, I did a massive refactor in just over 2 weeks, re-creating large parts of the project.

The before-refactor-project can be found **[here](https://github.com/Hopson97/open-builder/tree/a452dfd0a5d8fc94059f7e1ab8ecca03dd06ba3a)**

The commit that adds the refactored code can be found **[here](https://github.com/Hopson97/open-builder/tree/9b6c7c83fb1331fa8740ad12d6df9390d5b31c0c)**
