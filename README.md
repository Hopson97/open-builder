Open source Minecraft-like voxel sandbox game with multiplayer support.

More information about the project can be found in the **[Open Builder Wiki](https://github.com/Hopson97/open-builder/wiki)**

This was made mostly for a YouTube series which can be found here: **[Lets Code A Multiplayer Voxel Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rg1RriQZ9Q&list=PLMZ_9w2XRxiYb-ewSron6jd2fC1UHbDbJ&index=2)**

## Installing, Building and Running

### Windows [Visual Studio]

Please use the links below:

### Linux

We offer an automated installer for a bunch of different Linux distributions including Debian, Arch/Manjaro and Fedora. It can be ran via

```sh
sudo bash scripts/install.sh
```

from the project root directory. If you are interested in the manual way of installation, check below instructions. To then finally run the application see [Running](https://github.com/Hopson97/open-builder#running) below.

#### Manual Installation

##### Libraries

These are required for the project, and usually can be downloaded via your distributions

```sh
sudo apt install libsfml-dev libglm-dev
```

If not, then you can download them from the website:

```sh
sudo apt install cmake
```

First clone the project and `cd`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Hopson97/open-builder.git
cd open-builder
```

To build, at the root of the project:

```sh
sh scripts/build.sh
```

#### Running

To run, at the root of the project:

```sh

## History

Originally, this was going to be a Zombie game, but I got very bored of that very quickly, and so changed the project to be a voxel game instead.

As a result of this, the code was created for the zombie game, so when I decided to switch over, the code got messy very quickly.

To combat this, I did a masive refactor in just over 2 weeks, re-creating the most the project.

The before refactor can be found **[here](https://github.com/Hopson97/open-builder/tree/a452dfd0a5d8fc94059f7e1ab8ecca03dd06ba3a)**

The commit that adds the refactored code can be found **[here](https://github.com/Hopson97/open-builder/tree/9b6c7c83fb1331fa8740ad12d6df9390d5b31c0c)**
